<p>Before we could begin with plotting out the foam to carve the prototype fursuit head, we needed a reference to work from.
Since we did not have our own mannequin heads yet, I looked up images of head bases in Google and found a convenient turnaround which I loaded in Photoshop and laid out in such a way that I could easily sketch over it.</p>

<h4 id="to-the-drawing-board:bd6efe38cf959a7fa683dd2331df3df2">To the Drawing Board</h4>

<p>Since I am more familiar with <a href="http://furbuild.com/character/caraid">my own character</a> I started with her.
Initially, we wanted to go for a more realistic approach but weren&rsquo;t happy with the way it looked.</p>

<p><img src="http://furbuild.com/images/sketch-realistic-caraid.jpg" alt="Realistic Caraid sketch" /></p>

<p>So instead, we went for slightly more stylized heads, with larger eyes, a more expressive face and slightly exaggerated proportions.</p>

<p><img src="http://furbuild.com/images/sketch-stylized-caraid.jpg" alt="Stylized Caraid sketch" /></p>

<p>After having sketched out my own character, it was easy enough to translate the features and proportions onto <a href="http://furbuild.com/character/zee">Zee&rsquo;s</a> head.</p>

<p><img src="http://furbuild.com/images/sketch-stylized-zee.jpg" alt="Stylized Zee sketch" /></p>

<p>While not relevant yet, I was curious to see what our characters would look like in color so I roughed in their colorations after having finished the sketches.</p>

<h4 id="getting-the-measurements:bd6efe38cf959a7fa683dd2331df3df2">Getting the measurements</h4>

<p>Obviously, the digital head I had in Photoshop and our mannequins were not of the same size, so to translate my sketches into real life measurements I had to calculate the ratio between the virtual head and the real one.
We did this by measuring the width of our mannequins at the widest part of the head, then measuring the width of the digital mannequin (Photoshop has a ruler tool which you can use for this).</p>

<p>While the exact measurements are not particularly relevant for this article, we found out that the digital head was <code>10cm</code> wide, and the real one <code>19cm</code>.
This meant that the ratio for all of the measurements was <code>1.9:1</code>.</p>

<p>So, all we had to do now was get the measurements of the sketch, multiply them by <code>1.9</code> and we would have the real life measurements.</p>

  <p>I have been an enthusiastic hobbyist for many years prior to starting my artistic career. I enjoys a large variety of games, music, films and books which, occasionally combined with a glass of red wine or cup of coffee, are the fuel for my imagination. I graduated for my BA in Game Art at the USAT in 2014 and I now work freelance as an illustrator and concept artist.</p>
